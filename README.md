### What I learned

This lesson ive learned how to properly align the div in the middle using flexbox

```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely still need to practice with polishing my CSS code
